# Files in this directory will set/remove u-boot variables.
# Files are loaded in alphabetical order, 00_defaults contains
# defaults provided by Armadillo Base OS and can be updated without
# notice so do not modify that file; create new ones instead.

# variables are set as 'variable=value', for example uncommenting the
# following line will set bootdelay to -2 and disable boot prompt:
#bootdelay=-2

# listing a variable without a value will unset the value, for example
# uncommenting the following line would unset 'upgrade_available' and
# disable the bootcount mechanism:
#upgrade_available=
