3.19-at.4
=========
- installer improvements & fixes:
 - fix mounting user partition, this had stopped working in 3.18-at.5 with the
removal of util-linux's mount command.
 - everything printed to console is logged in /tmp/install.log (and sent to
server if set); it is also logged to /var/log/messages of the installed system
for immediate local checks
 - verify that boot partition has been set properly immediately after having
set it. kernels 5.10.210 and 5.10.213 had a bug where mmc commands would
sometimes be ignored.

  -- 2023-07-05

3.17-at.7

3.17-at.6
=========
common installer: fix bootcount variable not being reset due to invalid
fw_env.config in installer image

  -- 2023-05-29

3.17-at.5
=========
common:
- fw_env.config: write the file dynamically at install time
- Add --cache support to build offline or tested release.
The cache will be published to d.a.c together with the rootfs.
- The archive built from cache is now reproducible.
- NetworkManager: change how we mark interfaces as disabled.
The new method allows overriding at runtime more easily, and is
more flexible when wanting to add more such interfaces.
- update swupdate_preserve_rules (udev rules)
- fix motd being printed at boot
- rework mount options used everywhere: some mounts were not using
noatime, btrfs for rootfs should use compress-force.

a6e:
- fix installing uboot image when padding was not present.
The padding is required when writing to mmcblkXbootY as well.

qemu:
- fix broken pieces; since we're not using uboot it's not perfect
but it's good enough for basic tests.

internal notes:
- add jenkins/ directory that isn't included in release tarball
- temporarily hide a640: will be reverted immediately after release.

  -- 2023-04-26

  -- 2023-03-28

3.17-at.3
